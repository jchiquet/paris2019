## Speaker Guidelines

### Audience

We currently have around 200 people registered for the conference. There's bound to be some no shows on the day, but you can still anticipate a horde of R enthusiastics hanging on your every word.

### Registration

Try to arrive early on the day to avoid the crowd at registration. Along with the conference bag that all delegates will receive, you'll also get a speakers' shirt. If you choose to wear your shirt at the conference, that'd be great.

### Talk Durations

- Tutorial - 60 minutes (we'd originally planned on 90 minutes)
- Standard Talk - 20 minutes (ideally 15 minutes of talking and 5 minutes for questions and transition)
- Lightning Talk - 5 minutes (questions if time permits)

We know that the timing is very tight. The chair of each session will be focusing on keeping everything on schedule.

There will be somebody at the back of the room who will indicate the number of minutes you have left with large cards labelled 10:00, 5:00, 2:00 and 1:00.

If you run over time, the chair will gently cut you off!

Please ensure that your talk will fit into the time allotted. A few rehearsals might not hurt!

### Hardware

There will be a microphone, lectern, projector and screen in the venue.

In light of the tight schedule we'd prefer to avoid compatability issues between laptops and screens. So there'll be a single Mac hooked up to the projector.

Please provide us with a copy of your presentation well in advance, so that we can test it out on the hardware. We'll need to have those presentations by 18:00 on 16 February.

It's not a problem if you need to make last minute revisions to your presentation. We'll accept those with pleasure. But please try to avoid this eventuality!

The single Mac setup will not apply to the tutorials. We understand that the nature of a tutorial might require particular software setup, so tutorial speakers should please bring their own machines. Arrive some time before your tutorial is scheduled so that we can iron out any problems matching laptop to projector.
